I know there is also an extra [gamepad app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.appground.gamepad), but unfortunately it doesn't work in my use case (mouse and gamepad needs to work with the same bluetooth-mac).

Here is a custom layout (workaround), that works with most emulators and game services.  
e.g.: Steam, RetroArch or RetroPie


Note / known issues:
- Touchpad can be used as thumbstick.
- Button combos aren't seamlessly and needs to be pressed button by button (e.g.: Street Fighter - Hadouken: ↓→ + Punch)
